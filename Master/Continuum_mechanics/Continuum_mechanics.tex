\chapter{Continuum mechanics in different frames of reference}
All materials are made up of atoms, and between atoms there is space. The laws that govern these atoms are complex and are very difficult to model. However materials like solids and fluids can be modeled if we assume them to exist as a continuum. This means that we assume that there exist no space inside the materials and they fill completely up the space they occupy. 
We can use mathematics with basic physical laws to model fluids and solids when they are assumed continuous. These laws are generally expressed in two frames of reference, Lagrangian and Eulerian. To exemplify these frameworks we can imagine a river running down a mountain. In the Eulerian framework we are the observer standing still besides the river looking at the flow. We are not interested in each fluid particle but only how the fluid acts as a whole flowing down the river. This approach fits the fluid problem as we can imagine the fluid continuously deforming along the river side. \newline

In the Lagrangian description we have to imagine ourselves on a leaf going down the river with the flow. Looking out as the mountain moves and we stand still compared to the fluid particles. This description fits a solid problem nicely since we are generally interested in where the solid particles are in relation to each other. For instance modeling a beam attached to a wall at one end and a weight at the other end. We can imagine the beam bending and to model this bending we need to where all the particles are compared to each other. The more force that is applied the more the particles move in relation to eachother. \newline

In this chapter I will introduce both of these frameworks and the equations which are needed to model Fluid and Structure separately. I start with the Lagrangian description, by providing a short introduction to Lagrangian physics for the sake of completeness. Then introduce the solid and fluid equations. For a more detailed look on Lagrangian physics and the solid equation see \cite{Holzapfel2000}.

\begin{comment}
Let $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^d $ for $d \in \{1,2\}$, be a bounded domain with boundary $ \partial \Omega$. The domain is made up of of two sub domains $ \mathcal{F} $ for the fluid domain, and $\mathcal{S}$ for the solid. The interface between the domains are denoted by $ \Sigma = \mathcal{F} \cap \mathcal{S} $. The reference or initial is denoted by $ \hat{\Sigma} = \hat{\mathcal{F}} \cap \hat{\mathcal{S}}  $
