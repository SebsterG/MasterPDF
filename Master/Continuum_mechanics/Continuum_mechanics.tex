\chapter{Continuum mechanics}
Materials like fluid and solids are made up of atoms, and between atoms there is space. However solids and fluids can be modeled if we assume them to exist as a continuum. This means that there exist no space inside the materials and they fill completely up the space they occupy. Using mathematics we can model fluids and solids using basic physical laws. These laws are generally defined in two frameworks, Lagrangian and Eulerian. A way of thinking about these frameworks is if we imagine a river running down a mountain. In the Eulerian framework we are the observer standing still besides the river looking at the flow. We are not interested in each fluid particle but only how the fluid acts as a whole flowing down the river. This approach fits the fluid problem nicely as we can imagine the fluid continuously deforming along the river side.\newline
In the Lagrangian description we have to imagine ourselves on a leaf going down the river with the flow. Looking out as the mountain moves and we stand still compared to the fluid particles. This description fits a solid problem nicely since we are generally interested in where the solid particles are in relation to each other.  
In this chapter I will introduce both of these frameworks and the equations which are needed to model Fluid Structure Interaction. I start with the Lagrangian description and the solid equation.
