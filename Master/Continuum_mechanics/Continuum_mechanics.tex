\chapter{Continuum mechanics in different frames of reference}
Matter is made up of small building blocks called atoms, that are separated by vacuum, and the fundamental laws at this small scale are described using quantum mechanics. The associated characteristic length scale far smaller than most things of interest at a a macroscopic level. Since it has been observed that the characteristic behavior is statistically uniform, it is reasonable to assume the matter can be mathematically described, and modeled, as a continuum. This allows for a mathematical description at the macroscopic level using Newtonian physical laws to model fluids and solids. The Newtonian laws are generally expressed in one out of two frames of reference, Lagrangian or Eulerian, depending on the physical problem. \newline

To exemplify the differences between these frameworks, one can imagine a river running down a mountain.	
In the Eulerian framework we observe an object following the flow, standing besides the river. We are not necessarily interested in each fluid particle or the history of it, but only how the fluid acts as a whole flowing down the river. The Eulerian framework is especially advantageous to describe fluid mechanics.\newline

A Lagrangian description of solid mechanics is particularly beneficial, as one is generally interested in where the solid particles are in relation to each other and the particles initial spatial state.  
This is best exemplified with a deflecting beam attached to a wall. The more force applied to the beam the more it will deflect, relative to its historical stress free configuration. As described later this frame of reference is generally beneficial to describe stress and strain for solid mechanical problems.\newline

The goal of this chapter is to briefly introduce convervation of linear momentum for a fluid and a solid, respectively together with the respective boundary conditions. A derivation and a more detailed description of the Lagrangian framework and the stress and strain relations are covered in the appendix A1.

\begin{comment}
Let $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^d $ for $d \in \{1,2\}$, be a bounded domain with boundary $ \partial \Omega$. The domain is made up of of two sub domains $ \mathcal{F} $ for the fluid domain, and $\mathcal{S}$ for the solid. The interface between the domains are denoted by $ \Sigma = \mathcal{F} \cap \mathcal{S} $. The reference or initial is denoted by $ \hat{\Sigma} = \hat{\mathcal{F}} \cap \hat{\mathcal{S}}  $
