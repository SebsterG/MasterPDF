\section{Fluid and Structure Boundary conditions}
In order to obtain a unique solution to the fluid and solid equations, we need to specify a computational domain and impose boundary conditions. The fluid flow and the solid moves within the boundaries noted as $ \partial\mathcal{F}$ and $ \partial \mathcal{S}$ respectively. 

Dirichlet boundary conditions, often referred to as essential ones, are defined on the boundaries $ \partial \mathcal{F}_D$ and $ \partial \mathcal{S}_D$,
Dirichlet boundary conditions can be fixed or time varying values, such as zero at the fluid boundary for a "no slip" condition, or a Womersley profile at the inlet of a pipe. For a problem to be well posed we need to prescribe initial conditions.
The Dirichlet conditions are defined for $\bold{u}$ and $p$ as :
\begin{align}
\bold{u} =& u_0 \text{   on   } \partial \mathcal{F}_D  \\
p =& p_0 \text{   on   } \partial \mathcal{F}_D  \\
\bold{d} =& d_0 \text{ on   } \partial \mathcal{S}_D  \\
\bold{w}(\textbf{X},t)_0 =& \frac{\partial \bold{d}(t=0)}{\partial t} \text{   on   } \partial \mathcal{S}_D   
\end{align}

In addition, there are Neumann boundary conditions, often referred to as natural, which states a specific value of the derivative of a solution at the boundary. More specifically, $\partial \mathcal{F}_N$ and $\partial \mathcal{S}_N$. One can also control eventual forces on the Neumann boundary, to possibly equal an external force $ \bold{f}$:
\begin{align}
\sigma \cdot \bold{n} &= f \text{   on   } \partial \mathcal{F}_N \\   
P\cdot \bold{n} &= f \text{   on   } \partial \mathcal{S}_N    
\end{align}

For the sake of completeness, it should be noticed that there exists the Roben boundary conditions, which is the Dirichlet and Neumann conditions combined.
