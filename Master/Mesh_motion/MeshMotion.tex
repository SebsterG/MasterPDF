\chapter{Mesh motion techniques}
In this section we compare different mesh motion techniques from \ref{sec:meshmotion}. The test will be run using a version of the CSM test discussed earlier. The tests will compare the different techniques by looking at the how the deformation is lifted into the fluid domain. This is done by looking at a plot of the mesh after deformation to see how much cells distort and why. This is done using Paraview
