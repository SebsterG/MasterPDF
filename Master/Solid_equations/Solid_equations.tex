\chapter{Solid Equations}
In this chapter we will look briefly into the solid equation. The solid equation is most commonly described in a Lagrangian description. In a Lagrangian description the material particles are fixed with the grid points, this is a useful property when tracking the solid domain.

\section*{Lagrangian physics}
\subsection*{Mapping and identites}
We will start by providing a short introduction to Lagrangian physics for the sake of completeness.
\begin{center}

\end{center}
We define $ \hat{\mathcal{S}}$ as the initial stress free configuration of a given body, $\mathcal{S}$ as the reference and $\mathcal{S}(t)$ as the current configuration respectively.
We need to define a smooth mapping from the reference configuration to the current configuration:
\begin{equation}
\chi^s(t) : \hat{\mathcal{S}} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}(t)     
\end{equation}
Following the notation of \cite{Holzapfel2000},where $\textbf{X}$ denote a material point in the reference domain and $\chi^s$ denotes the mapping from the reference configuration. 
Let $d^s(\textbf{X},t)$ denote the displacement field and w(\textbf{X},t) the domain velocity. We then set the mapping
\begin{equation}
 \chi^s(\textbf{X},t) = \textbf{X}  + d^s(\textbf{X} ,t) 
\end{equation}

where $d^s(\textbf{X} ,t)$ represents displacement field
\begin{equation}
 d^s(\textbf{X},t) = \chi^s(\textbf{X},t) -\textbf{X}   
\end{equation}
and the domain velocity is the partial time derivative: 
\begin{equation}
 w(\textbf{X},t) = \frac{\partial \chi^s(\textbf{X},t)}{\partial t}   
\end{equation}

Next we will need a function that describes the rate of deformation in the solid.
\subsection*{Deformation gradient}
When a continuum body undergoes deformation and is moved from the reference configuration to some current configuration we need a deformation gradient that describes the rate of deformation in the body. 
If $d(\textbf{X},t)$ is a differentiable deformation field in a given body. We define the deformation gradient as:  
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:deformation_gradient}
F = \frac{\partial \chi}{\partial \textbf{X}} = I + \nabla d(\textbf{X},t) 
\end{equation}
which denotes relative change of position under deformation in a Lagrangian frame of reference.  

A change in volume between reference ($dv$) and current ($dV$) configuration is defined as :
\begin{align}
\label{eq:det_F}
dv =& J dV\\
J =& \text{det}(F)
\end{align}
Where J is the determinant of the deformation gradient F known as the Jacobian determinant or volume ratio. If there is no motion, that is $ F = I$ and $J=1$ , there is no change in volume. But we can also have the constraint $J=1$ with motion, but preserving the volume.
If we assume infinitesimal line and area elements in the current $ds, dx$ and reference $dV,dX$ configurations. The volume elements $dv, dV$ can be expressed by the dot product:
\begin{equation}
 dv = ds\cdot dx = J dS dX
\end{equation}
This is used to get the Nansons formula:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Nanson}
ds = JF^{-T}dS
\end{equation}
which holds for an arbitrary line element in different configurations.

\subsection*{Strain}
In continuum mechanics relative change of location of particles is called strain and this is the fundamental quality that causes stress in a material. \cite{Richter2016}. An import strain measure is the right Cauchy-Green tensor 
$$C = F^TF$$ 
which is symmetric and positive definite $C = C^T$.  We also introduce the Green-Lagrangian strain tensor E:
$$E = \frac{1}{2}(F^TF -I) $$
which is also symmetric since C and I are symmetric. This measures the squared length change under deformation.
		
\subsection*{Stress}
Stress is the internal forces between neighboring particles. We introduce the Cauchy stress tensor:
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_s = \frac{1}{J} F(\lambda_s (tr E)I + 2\mu_sE) F^T
\end{equation}
Using \eqref{eq:Nanson} we get the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor P:
\begin{equation}
 P = J \sigma F^{-T} 
\end{equation}
We also introduce the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor S:
\begin{equation}
S = J F^{-1}\sigma F^{-T} = F^{-1} P = S^T 
\end{equation}
from this relation we can write the first Piola-Kirchhoff tensor by the second:
\begin{equation}
P = FS
\end{equation}
\subsection*{Solid equation}
From the principles of conservation of mass and momentum, we get the solid equation stated in the Lagrangian reference system (Following the notation from \cite{Richter2016}):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Solid}
\rho_s \frac{\partial d^2}{\partial t^2} = \nabla \cdot ( P ) + \rho_s f 
\end{equation}
where we used the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor.

\subsection*{Locking}
The problem og shear locking can happen FEM computations with certain elements. 
[mek4250 Kent] - Locking occurs if  $ \lambda >> \nu $ that is, the material is nearly incompressible. The reason is that all the elements discussed in this course are poor at approximating the divergence. Locking refers to the case where the displacement is to small because the divergence term essentially lock the displacement. It is a numerical artifact not a physical feature. [Verbatum]
