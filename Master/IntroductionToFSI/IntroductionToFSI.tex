\chapter{Introduction to Fluid-Structure Interaction}
The interaction between fluids and structures can be observed all around us in nature.
From a flag waving in the wind to a large windmill at sea, when we breath in air and our lungs expand, are all examples of fluids and structures interacting. 
Both fluids and structures exert mutual force on each other. For instance, a flag waving in the wind is mainly air (fluid) exerting force on the flag (structure), making the flag flutter. An example of structure exerting force and starting an interaction, is when we breathe air into our lungs. When we breath our diaphram contracts and moves downward, increasing the space in our chest cavity making the lungs expand. As the lungs expand air is sucked through the mouth and nose, filling up the lungs. 

Accurately modeling Fluid-Structure Interaction can help prevent disasters and is exemplified by the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940 \cite{Billah1991}. The bridge collapsed only two months after being opened. The collapse was due to strong winds (64 km/h) interacting with the structure, making the bridge flutter and ultimately collapse. No human lives were lost in the collapse, but a Cocker Spaniel named Tubby left behind in a car was not that lucky and lost its life in the bridge collapse. If we could build a model that could simulate the interaction between the bridge and the air, we could have known how high wind speeds the bridge could handle before collapsing. \newline

Modeling FSI is used when constructing for instance windmills. The blades on windmills are normally considered stiff relative to the flowing air, hence giving a big difference in density between fluid and structure $\frac{\rho_f}{\rho_s} << 1$. The structure will in the case of a windmill only give rise to small deformations.
However, modeling FSI in hemodynamics(dynamics of blood flow) deems more challenging. In the latter example the densities in fluid and structure and blood flow usually induces large deformations in the veins and arteries. Modeling FSI with large deformations is challenging because it gives the need hyper elastic structure models, and energy stable schemes.
In both the examples of windmills and blood flow, the fluid flow tends to transitions towards turbulence. Hence giving the need for a solver to handle high fluid velocities. \newline

One field of study within fluid dynamics is called Computational Fluid Dynamics, where computers and numerical analyses are used to solve fluid problems.
I would argue that a similar name is used for FSI, namely \textit{Computational Fluid Structure Interaction} (CFSI). However in the literature FSI is used to describe CFSI and the name FSI will be used in this thesis. Also, even though FSI is Fluid-\textit{Structure} Interaction, the word solid will also be used to describe a structure. \newline

The main goal of this master thesis is to build a framework to solve FSI problems, investigating different approaches and schemes. The framework will be verified using the \textit{Method of Manufactured Solutions}, and validated using a classic, well known benchmark, known to test the robustness of a FSI solver.



\begin{comment}
Fluid-Structure Interaction problem can be observed all around us in nature, from large industrial engineering complexes to the smallest blood vessels in the human body. A large scale example is the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge that collapsed in 1940 only two months after being opened. The collapse was due to aero-elastic fluttering from strong winds. No human life was lost in the collapse, but a cocker spaniel name Tubby left in a car was not so lucky. The construction of windmills are a second example of the Fluid-Structure Interaction problem. Todays windmills are rigid and hence giving a big difference in density between fluid and structure, $ \rho_s >> \rho_f $. The structure will therefore only give rise to small deformations. However applying FSI to hemodynamics( dynamics of blood flow ) deems more challenging. One FSI hemodynamic problem are inter-cranial aneurysms, which are balloon shaped geometries often occurring where a blood vessel splits into two parts, due to weak vessel walls. Bursting of one of these aneurysms in the skull can have fatale consequences. With fluid and structure densities more equal than the previous example, the structure has an elastic character giving under the right circumstances large deformations. The blood flow also transitions to turbulent flow. This combination gives the need for a rigid stabile solver. Therefore the main goal of this master thesis is to build a framework to solve the FSI problem, investigating different approaches and schemes. The framework will be validated and verified using MMS, companying a wide range of benchmarks.
