\section*{Acknowlegments}
First of I want to thank by brilliant supervisors Dr.Kristian Valen-Sendstad, Dr.Mikael Mortensen and Aslak Bergersen. Kristian your guidance and humor as made my time working on my thesis very pleasurable. Aslak, your tough love has kept me on my tippy toes at all times, and your problem solving abilities are of the absolute highest caliber. And to Mikael who has always kept his door open and answered my at times not so intelligent questions.

I also want to thank my good friend and study buddy Andreas Slyngstad. I have much appreciated the many fun times and discussions I have had with Andy during the 5 years of study and in the last year at Simula working on a related problem, I have gained much insight from him.							
				
I want to thank my family for letting me become whatever I want, as long as it is an engineer. And also my wonderful girlfriend Marlene, for her uncanny love and support.

Lastly I want to thank my dog Sara, for always waging her tail, making me happy.
