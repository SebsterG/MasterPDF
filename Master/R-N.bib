abstract = {We introduce a class of explicit coupling schemes for the numerical solution of fluid-structure interaction problems involving a viscous incompressible fluid and a general thin-walled structure (e.g., including damping and non-linear behavior). The fundamental ingredient in these methods is a (parameter free) explicit Robin interface condition for the fluid, which enables the fluid-solid splitting through appropriate extrapolations of the solid velocity and fluid stress on the interface. The resulting solution procedures are genuinely partitioned. Stability and error estimates are provided for all the variants (depending on the extrapolations), using energy arguments within a representative linear setting. In particular, we show that one of them simultaneously yields added-mass free unconditional stability and optimal (first-order) time accuracy. A comprehensive numerical study, involving different examples from the literature, supports the theory. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Fernandez2015,
abstract = {This paper presents an analytical model and a geometric numerical integrator for a tethered spacecraft model that is composed of two rigid bodies connected by an elastic tether. This model includes important dynamic characteristics of tethered spacecraft in orbit, namely the nonlinear coupling between tether deformations, rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, a reeling mechanism, and orbital dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},
