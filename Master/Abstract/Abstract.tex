\section*{Abstract}
This thesis has developed a framework for solving Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problem using a monolithic scheme. Introducing the mathematics and physics that govern fluid and structures, and the conditions needed to model FSI problems. I have discussed the challenges one meets when trying to model and compute FSI problems. I have introduced the $\theta-$scheme meant to uphold stability for long time FSI problems. The code has been verified in parts using MMS. \newline

Using the proposal benchmark from Hron and Turek 2010, I have validated the FSI solver first in fluid and structure separately and finally for a full FSI problem. I have compared data to contributions made by others imposing similar schemes. I have shown how crucial the choice of lifting operator is for computing FSI problems with moderate to large deformations, and the need for a stable scheme for long run times.

Investigations have been made into the effects of different lifting operators and different ordered numerical schemes.
