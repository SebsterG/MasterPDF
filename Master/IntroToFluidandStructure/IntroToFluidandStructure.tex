Before considering the full FSI problem will discuss the fluid and solid equations separately. These equations will be stated in different frameworks. The fluid is described in an Eulerian framework, where points in the domain are fixed and the fluid flow passes through these points. This reasoning can be understood if one were to stand by the side of river and watch the water flow down. The continuous deformation of fluid flow makes this the most sensible approach, " the water becomes the cup" so to speak.
