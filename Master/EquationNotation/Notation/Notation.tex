\section*{Notation}
Let $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^d $ for $d \in \{2\}$, be a bounded domain with boundary $ \partial \Omega$. The domain is made up of of two sub domains $ \mathcal{F} $ for the fluid domain, and $\mathcal{S}$ for the solid. The interface between the domains are denoted by $ \Sigma = \mathcal{F} \cap \mathcal{S} $. The reference or initial is denoted by $ \hat{\Sigma} = \hat{\mathcal{F}} \cap \hat{\mathcal{S}}  $ 
The functions will be denoted as:
$u$ - Velocity in fluid and structure. \\
$d$ - Displacement in the solid and in the fluid mesh.\\
$p$ - Pressure in the fluid. \\
