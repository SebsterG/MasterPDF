The best benchmarks are exact analytical solutions with sufficiently complex solution structure; they need not be realistic since Verification is a purely mathematical exercise. The Method of Manufactured Solutions ({\{}MMS{\}}) provides a straightforward and quite general procedure for generating such solutions. For complex codes, the method utilizes Symbolic Manipulation, but here it is illustrated with simple examples. When used with systematic grid refinement studies, which are remarkably sensitive, {\{}MMS{\}} produces strong Code Verifications with a theorem-like quality and a clearly defined completion point.},

abstract = {In computation of fluid-structure interactions, we use mesh update methods consisting of mesh-moving and remeshing-as-needed. When the geometries are complex and the struc- tural displacements are large, it becomes even more important that the mesh moving techniques are designed with the objective to reduce the frequency of remeshing. To that end, we present here mesh moving techniques where the motion of the nodes is governed by the equations of elasticity, with selective treatment of mesh deformation based on element sizes as well as deformation modes in terms of shape and volume changes. We also present results from application of these techniques to a set of two-dimensional test cases. ?DOI:},

@article{Oasis,
abstract = {Abstract Oasis is a high-level/high-performance finite element Navier–Stokes solver written from scratch in Python using building blocks from the FEniCS project (fenicsproject.org). The solver is unstructured and targets large-scale applications in complex geometries on massively parallel clusters. Oasis utilizes MPI and interfaces, through FEniCS, to the linear algebra backend PETSc. Oasis advocates a high-level, programmable user interface through the creation of highly flexible Python modules for new problems. Through the high-level Python interface the user is placed in complete control of every aspect of the solver. A version of the solver, that is using piecewise linear elements for both velocity and pressure, is shown to reproduce very well the classical, spectral, turbulent channel simulations of Moser et al. (1999). The computational speed is strongly dominated by the iterative solvers provided by the linear algebra backend, which is arguably the best performance any similar implicit solver using PETSc may hope for. Higher order accuracy is also demonstrated and new solvers may be easily added within the same framework.

abstract = {This paper outlines the development of a new procedure for analysing continuum mechanics problems with a particular focus on fluid–structure interaction in flexible tubes. A review of current methods of fluid–structure coupling highlights common limitations of high computational cost and solution instability. It is proposed that these limitations can be overcome by an alternative approach in which both fluid and solid components are solved within a single discretized continuum domain. A single system of momentum and continuity equations is therefore derived that governs both fluids and solids and which are solved with a single mesh using finite volume discretization schemes. The method is validated first by simulating dynamic oscillation of a clamped elastic beam. It is then applied to study the case of interest—wave propagation in highly flexible tubes—in which a predicted wave speed of 8.58m/s falls within 2{\%} of an approximate analytical solution. The method shows further good agreement with analytical solutions for tubes of increasing rigidity, covering a range of wave speeds from those found in arteries to that in the undisturbed fluid.},

The mesh movement is realized by solving an additional partial differential equation of harmonic, linear-elastic, or biharmonic type. We examine an implementation of time discretization that is designed with finite differences. Spatial discretization is based on a Galerkin finite element method. To solve the resulting discrete nonlinear systems, a Newton method with exact Jacobian matrix is used. Our results show that the biharmonic model produces the smoothest meshes but has increased computational cost compared to the other two approaches. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The subiteration method, which forms the basic iterative procedure for solving fluid- structure-interaction problems, is based on a partitioning of the fluid-structure system into a fluidic part and a structural part. In fluid-structure interaction, on short time scales the fluid appears as an added mass to the structural operator, and the stability and convergence properties of the subiteration process depend significantly on the ratio of this apparent added mass to the actual structural mass. In the present paper, we establish that the added-mass effects corresponding to compressible and incompressible flows are fundamentally different. For a model problem, we show that on increasingly small time intervals, the added mass of a compressible flow is proportional to the length of the time interval, whereas the added mass of an incompressible flow approaches a constant. We then consider the implications of this difference in proportionality for the stability and convergence properties of the subiteration process, and for the stability and accuracy of loosely coupled staggered time-integration methods.},

We discuss possible efficient strategies of setting up the resulting system and its solution. A 2-dimensional configuration is presented to test the developed method. It is based on the older successful DFG benchmark flow around cylinder for incompressible laminar fluid flow. Similar to this older benchmark we consider the flow to be incompressible and in the laminar regime. The structure is allowed to be compressible or incompressible and the deformations of the structure are periodic and significant in terms of displacement.

abstract = {Nonlinear Solid Mechanics a Continuum Approach for Engineering Gerhard A. Holzapfel Graz University of Technology, Austria With a modern, comprehensive approach directed towards computational mechanics, this book covers a unique combination of subjects at present unavailable in any other text. It includes vital information on 'variational principles' constituting the cornerstone of the finite element method. In fact this is the only method by which Nonlinear Solid Mechanics is utilized in engineering practice. The book opens with a fundamental chapter on vectors and tensors. The following chapters are based on nonlinear continuum mechanics - an inevitable prerequisite for computational mechanicians. In addition, continuum field theory (applied to a representative sample of hyperelastic materials currently used in nonlinear computations such as incompressible and compressible materials) is presented, as are transversely isotropic materials, composite materials, viscoelastic materials and hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage. Another central chapter is devoted to the thermodynamics of materials, covering both finite thermoelasticity and finite thermoviscoelasticity. Also included are: an up-to-date list of almost 300 references and a comprehensive index useful examples and exercises for the student selected topics of statistical and continuum thermodynamics. Furthermore, the principle of virtual work (in both the material and spatial descriptions) is compared with two and three-field variational principles particularly designed to capture kinematic constraints such as incompressibility. All of the features combined result in an essential text for final year undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering and applied maths and physics.},

abstract = {Verification and validation (V{\&}V) are the primary means to assess accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V{\&}V in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V{\&}V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V{\&}V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V{\&}V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors' contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V{\&}V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V{\&}V in production and commercial software.},

@article{Billah1991,
abstract = {The dramatic Tacoma Narrows bridge disaster of 1940 is still very much in the public eye today. Notably, in many undergraduate physics texts the disaster is presented as an example of elementary forced resonance of a mechanical oscillator, with the wind providing an external periodic frequency that matched the natural structural frequency. This oversimplified explanation has existed in numerous texts for a long time and continues to this day, with even more detailed presentation in some new and updated texts. Engineers, on the other hand, have studied the phenomenon over the past half‐century, and their current understanding differs fundamentally from the viewpoint expressed in most physics texts. In the present article the engineers' viewpoint is presented to the physics community to make it clear where substantial disagreement exists. First it is pointed out that one misleading identification of forced resonance arises from the notion that the periodic natural vortex shedding of the wind over the structure was the source of the damaging external excitation. It is then demonstrated that the ultimate failure of the bridge was in fact related to an aerodynamically induced condition of self‐excitation or ‘‘negative damping'' in a torsional degree of freedom. The aeroelastic phenomenon involved was an interactive one in which developed wind forces were strongly linked to structural motion. This paper emphasizes the fact that, physically as well as mathematically, forced resonance and self‐excitation are fundamentally different phenomena. The paper closes with a quantitative assessment of the Tacoma Narrows phenomenon that is in full agreement with the documented action of both the bridge itself in its final moments and a full, dynamically scaled model of it studied in the 1950s.},

abstract = {Fluid-structure interactions (FSI), i.e., the interplay of some moveable or deformable structure with an internal or surrounding fluid, are among the most widespread and most challenging coupled or multi-physics problems. Although much has been accomplished in developing good computational FSI methods and despite convincing solutions to a number of classes of problems including those presented in this book, there is a need for more comprehensive studies showing that the computational methods proposed are reliable, robust, and efficient beyond the classes of problems they have successfully been applied to.This volume of LNCSE, a sequel to vol. 53, which contained, among others, the first numerical benchmark for FSI problems and has received considerable attention since then, presents a collection of papers from the "First International Workshop on Computational Engineering - special focus FSI," held in Herrsching in October 2009 and organized by three DFG-funded consortia. The papers address all relevant aspects of FSI simulation and discuss FSI from the mathematical, informatical, and engineering perspective.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a stable second-order time accurate scheme for solving fluid-structure interaction problems. The scheme uses so-called Combined Field with Explicit Interface (CFEI) advancing formulation based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach with finite element procedure. Although loosely-coupled partitioned schemes are often popular choices for simulating FSI problems, these schemes may suffer from inherent instability at low structure to fluid density ratios. We show that our second-order scheme is stable for any mass density ratio and hence is able to handle strong added-mass effects. Energy-based stability proof relies heavily on the connections among extrapolation formula, trapezoidal scheme for second-order equation, and backward difference method for first-order equation. Numerical accuracy and stability of the scheme is assessed with the aid of two-dimensional fluid-structure interaction problems of increasing complexity. We confirm second-order temporal accuracy by numerical experiments on an elastic semi-circular cylinder problem. We verify the accuracy of coupled solutions with respect to the benchmark solutions of a cylinder-elastic bar and the Navier-Stokes flow system. To study the stability of the proposed scheme for strong added-mass effects, we present new results using the combined field formulation for flexible flapping motion of a thin-membrane structure with low mass ratio and strong added-mass effects in a uniform axial flow. Using a systematic series of fluid-structure simulations, a detailed analysis of the coupled response as a function of mass ratio for the case of very low bending rigidity has been presented. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The goal of this work is the development of concepts for the efficient numerical solution of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with applications to heart-valve dynamics. The main motivation for further development in this field is an increasing demand from the medical community for scientifically rigorous investigations of cardiovascular diseases, which are responsible for the major fraction of mortalities in industrialized countries. In this work, the ALE (arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) description of fluid equations is utilized for the numerical modeling and simulation of fluid-structure interactions. Using this approach, the fluid equations can easily be coupled with structural deformations. The focal goal is the modeling, numerical analysis, and simulation of prototypical heart-valve dynamics, which requires the investigation of the following issues: the analysis of various fluid-mesh motion techniques, a comparison of different second-order time-stepping schemes, and the prescription of specific boundary conditions on the artificial outflow boundary. To control computational costs, we apply a simplified version of an a posteriori error estimation using the dual weighted residual (DWR) method. This method is used for mesh adaption during the computation. The last, novel aspect comprises a discussion of optimal control problems for wall stress minimization, in which the state is determined by a fluid-structure interaction system. The concepts developed in this work are demonstrated with several numerical tests in two and three dimensions. The programming code is validated by computing several FSI benchmark tests. The focal computation is related to a prototypical two-dimensional aortic heart-valve simulation. The concepts illustrated by this example were developed in cooperation with a cardiologist.},
