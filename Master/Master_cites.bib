abstract = {We investigate a monolithic algorithm to solve the problem of time dependent interaction between an incompressible viscous fluid and an elastic solid. The continuous formulation of the problem and its discretization is done in a monolithic way, treating the problem as one continuum. The Q2/Pdis 1 finite elements are used for the discretization and an approximate Newton method with coupled multigrid linear solver is developed for solving the equations. We discuss possible efficient strategies of setting up the resulting system and its solution. A 2-dimensional configuration is presented to test the developed method. It is based on the older successful DFG benchmark flow around cylinder for incompressible laminar fluid flow. Similar to this older benchmark we consider the flow to be incompressible and in the laminar regime. The structure is allowed to be compressible or incompressible and the deformations of the structure are periodic and significant in terms of displacement. This configuration can be used to compare different numerical methods and code implementations for the fluid-structure interaction problem qualitatively and particularly quantitatively with respect to efficiency and accuracy of the computation.},

abstract = {Verification of Calculations involves error estimation, whereas Verification of Codes involves error evaluation, from known benchmark solutions. The best benchmarks are exact analytical solutions with sufficiently complex solution structure; they need not be realistic since Verification is a purely mathematical exercise. The Method of Manufactured Solutions ({\{}MMS{\}}) provides a straightforward and quite general procedure for generating such solutions. For complex codes, the method utilizes Symbolic Manipulation, but here it is illustrated with simple examples. When used with systematic grid refinement studies, which are remarkably sensitive, {\{}MMS{\}} produces strong Code Verifications with a theorem-like quality and a clearly defined completion point.},

@article{Langtangen2002,
abstract = {We present an overview of the most common numerical solution strategies for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, including fully implicit formulations, artificial compressibility methods, penalty formulations, and operator splitting methods (pressure/velocity correction, projection methods). A unified framework that explains popular operator splitting methods as special cases of a fully implicit approach is also presented and can be used for constructing new and improved solution strategies. The exposition is mostly neutral to the spatial discretization technique, but we cover the need for staggered grids or mixed finite elements and outline some alternative stabilization techniques that allow using standard grids. Emphasis is put on showing the close relationship between (seemingly) different and competing solution approaches for incompressible viscous flow.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analytical model and a geometric numerical integrator for a tethered spacecraft model that is composed of two rigid bodies connected by an elastic tether. This model includes important dynamic characteristics of tethered spacecraft in orbit, namely the nonlinear coupling between tether deformations, rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, a reeling mechanism, and orbital dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Nonlinear Solid Mechanics a Continuum Approach for Engineering Gerhard A. Holzapfel Graz University of Technology, Austria With a modern, comprehensive approach directed towards computational mechanics, this book covers a unique combination of subjects at present unavailable in any other text. It includes vital information on 'variational principles' constituting the cornerstone of the finite element method. In fact this is the only method by which Nonlinear Solid Mechanics is utilized in engineering practice. The book opens with a fundamental chapter on vectors and tensors. The following chapters are based on nonlinear continuum mechanics - an inevitable prerequisite for computational mechanicians. In addition, continuum field theory (applied to a representative sample of hyperelastic materials currently used in nonlinear computations such as incompressible and compressible materials) is presented, as are transversely isotropic materials, composite materials, viscoelastic materials and hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage. Another central chapter is devoted to the thermodynamics of materials, covering both finite thermoelasticity and finite thermoviscoelasticity. Also included are: an up-to-date list of almost 300 references and a comprehensive index useful examples and exercises for the student selected topics of statistical and continuum thermodynamics. Furthermore, the principle of virtual work (in both the material and spatial descriptions) is compared with two and three-field variational principles particularly designed to capture kinematic constraints such as incompressibility. All of the features combined result in an essential text for final year undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering and applied maths and physics.},
