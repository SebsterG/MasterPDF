abstract = {The subiteration method, which forms the basic iterative procedure for solving fluid- structure-interaction problems, is based on a partitioning of the fluid-structure system into a fluidic part and a structural part. In fluid-structure interaction, on short time scales the fluid appears as an added mass to the structural operator, and the stability and convergence properties of the subiteration process depend significantly on the ratio of this apparent added mass to the actual structural mass. In the present paper, we establish that the added-mass effects corresponding to compressible and incompressible flows are fundamentally different. For a model problem, we show that on increasingly small time intervals, the added mass of a compressible flow is proportional to the length of the time interval, whereas the added mass of an incompressible flow approaches a constant. We then consider the implications of this difference in proportionality for the stability and convergence properties of the subiteration process, and for the stability and accuracy of loosely coupled staggered time-integration methods.},

abstract = {Nonlinear Solid Mechanics a Continuum Approach for Engineering Gerhard A. Holzapfel Graz University of Technology, Austria With a modern, comprehensive approach directed towards computational mechanics, this book covers a unique combination of subjects at present unavailable in any other text. It includes vital information on 'variational principles' constituting the cornerstone of the finite element method. In fact this is the only method by which Nonlinear Solid Mechanics is utilized in engineering practice. The book opens with a fundamental chapter on vectors and tensors. The following chapters are based on nonlinear continuum mechanics - an inevitable prerequisite for computational mechanicians. In addition, continuum field theory (applied to a representative sample of hyperelastic materials currently used in nonlinear computations such as incompressible and compressible materials) is presented, as are transversely isotropic materials, composite materials, viscoelastic materials and hyperelastic materials with isotropic damage. Another central chapter is devoted to the thermodynamics of materials, covering both finite thermoelasticity and finite thermoviscoelasticity. Also included are: an up-to-date list of almost 300 references and a comprehensive index useful examples and exercises for the student selected topics of statistical and continuum thermodynamics. Furthermore, the principle of virtual work (in both the material and spatial descriptions) is compared with two and three-field variational principles particularly designed to capture kinematic constraints such as incompressibility. All of the features combined result in an essential text for final year undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering and applied maths and physics.},

abstract = {We investigate a monolithic algorithm to solve the problem of time dependent interaction between an incompressible viscous fluid and an elastic solid. The continuous formulation of the problem and its discretization is done in a monolithic way, treating the problem as one continuum. The Q2/Pdis 1 finite elements are used for the discretization and an approximate Newton method with coupled multigrid linear solver is developed for solving the equations. We discuss possible efficient strategies of setting up the resulting system and its solution. A 2-dimensional configuration is presented to test the developed method. It is based on the older successful DFG benchmark flow around cylinder for incompressible laminar fluid flow. Similar to this older benchmark we consider the flow to be incompressible and in the laminar regime. The structure is allowed to be compressible or incompressible and the deformations of the structure are periodic and significant in terms of displacement. This configuration can be used to compare different numerical methods and code implementations for the fluid-structure interaction problem qualitatively and particularly quantitatively with respect to efficiency and accuracy of the computation.},

A unified framework that explains popular operator splitting methods as special cases of a fully implicit approach is also presented and can be used for constructing new and improved solution strategies. The exposition is mostly neutral to the spatial discretization technique, but we cover the need for staggered grids or mixed finite elements and outline some alternative stabilization techniques that allow using standard grids. Emphasis is put on showing the close relationship between (seemingly) different and competing solution approaches for incompressible viscous flow.},

This model includes important dynamic characteristics of tethered spacecraft in orbit, namely the nonlinear coupling between tether deformations, rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, a reeling mechanism, and orbital dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a stable second-order time accurate scheme for solving fluid-structure interaction problems. The scheme uses so-called Combined Field with Explicit Interface (CFEI) advancing formulation based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach with finite element procedure. Although loosely-coupled partitioned schemes are often popular choices for simulating FSI problems, these schemes may suffer from inherent instability at low structure to fluid density ratios. We show that our second-order scheme is stable for any mass density ratio and hence is able to handle strong added-mass effects. Energy-based stability proof relies heavily on the connections among extrapolation formula, trapezoidal scheme for second-order equation, and backward difference method for first-order equation. Numerical accuracy and stability of the scheme is assessed with the aid of two-dimensional fluid-structure interaction problems of increasing complexity. We confirm second-order temporal accuracy by numerical experiments on an elastic semi-circular cylinder problem. We verify the accuracy of coupled solutions with respect to the benchmark solutions of a cylinder-elastic bar and the Navier-Stokes flow system. To study the stability of the proposed scheme for strong added-mass effects, we present new results using the combined field formulation for flexible flapping motion of a thin-membrane structure with low mass ratio and strong added-mass effects in a uniform axial flow. Using a systematic series of fluid-structure simulations, a detailed analysis of the coupled response as a function of mass ratio for the case of very low bending rigidity has been presented. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Oasis,
abstract = {Abstract Oasis is a high-level/high-performance finite element Navier–Stokes solver written from scratch in Python using building blocks from the FEniCS project (fenicsproject.org). The solver is unstructured and targets large-scale applications in complex geometries on massively parallel clusters. Oasis utilizes MPI and interfaces, through FEniCS, to the linear algebra backend PETSc. Oasis advocates a high-level, programmable user interface through the creation of highly flexible Python modules for new problems. Through the high-level Python interface the user is placed in complete control of every aspect of the solver. A version of the solver, that is using piecewise linear elements for both velocity and pressure, is shown to reproduce very well the classical, spectral, turbulent channel simulations of Moser et al. (1999). The computational speed is strongly dominated by the iterative solvers provided by the linear algebra backend, which is arguably the best performance any similar implicit solver using PETSc may hope for. Higher order accuracy is also demonstrated and new solvers may be easily added within the same framework.
