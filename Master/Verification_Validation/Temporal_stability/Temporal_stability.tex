\subsection{Temporal stability}
The following section will give a brief insight in to the effects of choosing different $\theta$ values in the $\theta-$scheme. The benchmark test FSI-2 has been used to since it is known to blow up with certain values of $\theta$ and $\Delta t$. Only the effects of Drag as been studied as the three other quantities shows the same behavior.

\ref{fig:FSI2drag_plots} show the plots of Drag with $\Delta t = 0.01$. It shows the instability when choosing $\theta = 0.5$. The Crank-Nicholson scheme is stable until about 13 seconds where we see that it blows up and the solver diverges. While the shifted Crank-Nicholson, $\theta = 0.5 + \Delta t$, is stable throughout the computing time.\newline

It has been reported in \cite{Wick2011} that the Crank-Nicholson, $\theta = 0.5$, scheme is stable throughout the computing time by setting $\Delta t = 0.001$.

Put in plot of $\theta = 0.5$ and $\Delta t = 0.001$ to see if its stable longer? +++++++
